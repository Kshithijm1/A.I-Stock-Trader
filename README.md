# A.I-Stock-Trader

This is a stock trader built using modules like tensorflow, sklearn, and matplotlib. This code trains the network with csv data of a certain chosen stock, uses multiple indicators including:
- KDJ
- RSI
- MACD
- EMA200
and determines the best buying and selling points on the stock graph for the day.
This code then plots the signals onto a chart of the stock with a green arrow being "buy" and a red arrow being "sell". Some objectives for the future would be to:
- Add more indicators
- implement an RNN to increase the accuracy of the program
